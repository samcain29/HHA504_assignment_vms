## GCP VM Cost

- **GCP Cost**: $0.05 for a few minutes of VM runtime.
## Reflection

I found Google Cloud Platform (GCP) to be user-friendly, especially for creating and managing a VM. The interface was straightforward, and the steps to create a VM were well-guided. The cost monitoring feature in GCP was also easy to find under the billing section, and I appreciated the clear breakdown of costs.

### Strengths:
- Simple UI for creating and stopping VMs.
- Clear billing section for cost tracking.

### Challenges:
- Initial setup might be confusing for first-time users due to various configuration options.
- Costs took over 24 hours to show up in Reports.
